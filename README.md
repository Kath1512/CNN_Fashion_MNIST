# CNN for Fashion MNIST from Scratch

A custom implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using NumPy and Pandas to classify fashion items (clothing, shoes, bags) from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Highlights
- **Scratch Implementation**: Developed core CNN components including 2D Convolutional layers, Max Pooling, and Flattening without high-level AI frameworks.
- **Feature Extraction**: Designed the network to automatically extract spatial hierarchies from image data.
- **Data Pipeline**: Includes custom data loading, normalization, and training loops with real-time accuracy tracking.

## Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
